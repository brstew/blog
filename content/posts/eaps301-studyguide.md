# Oil Geology

##### Hoes does oil/gas form?

Microscopic plants/animals die. The plants and animals die and create layers.

As it becomes deeper pressure and heat builds up. The heat and pressure creates the oil.

THe oil starts to go through the tiny pores in the rock. It goes towards the surface until it is trapped in impermeable layers of rock like clay.

##### What environmental conditions favor the formation of oil/gas?

There needs to be enough pressure to turn the plants into a liquid and then there needs to be porous rocks. Then there must be a cap rock to prevent the oil from going up.

Oil temp from 60 - 120 degrees celsisus and 6,000 - 15,000 ft. deep.

Gas temp over 140 degrees ceslsius and over 16,000 ft deep.

##### What periods in time were particularly important in the formation of oil?



##### What geologic features favor the formation of oil/gas?



##### What are source, reservoir, and cap formations?



##### What/where are well known and developed oil/gas regions?





# Oil Production 

##### How/where was oil/gas initially found?

Oil was initally found in Pennsylvania by Drake.

##### How is an oil well drilled?



##### How are modern oil/gas fields discovered?

##### The refining process?

##### Synfuel?

##### Petrochemicals (not formulas just products)

# Oil History


##### What was oil initally used as a replacement for and why?

Oil was used as a replacement for whale oil in lamps. This was due to the large increase in whale prices between 1831 and 1854.

##### Who are some of the major players early oil other than Rockefellar?

Marcus Samuel - founded Shell and drilled for oil in Baku.

##### Know about Rockefeller

Invented vertical integration controlling everything along the entire process of producing oil. Created one of the biggest oil empires until it was broken up in an antitrust case. 

Initially started out in buying refineries. He then moved onto building pipelines due to horses and wagons being too expensive to transport oil. Eventually he purchased oil wells. 

##### What happened socially during the “Roaring Twenties” that was the result of oil and the automobile?

During the roaring twenties people started driving and were now more independant. 


##### Texas oil wealth?
