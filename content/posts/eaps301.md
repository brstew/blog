##### How oil is found

Set off small explosions and record the time it takes for waves to make it back to the surface.

##### Hydrofracturing

Pump water into one side of oil reserver and the oil will then come out the extraction well.

##### How oil is produced



# Oil History
-------------

##### Before Oil

Before rock oil became popular whale oil was used to power lamps. Due to over hunting oil of whales, prices increased drastically from $0.30 in 1831 to $1.92 in 1854 per 2 liters. 


##### What is Rock Oil?

Made from dead phytoplankton that died millions of years ago. Made up of long changes of carbons and hydrogens. Examples Hexane and Benzene.

Oil is found in folds (anticline).

##### Big four oil producers

| Companies        | Founded            | Founders         |
| :--------------: | :----------------: | :--------------: |
| Standard (Exxon) | USA                | John Rockefeller |
| Shell            | Caspian Sea (Baku) | Marcus Samuel    |
| Royal Dutch      | Indonesia          |                  |
| BP               | Iran               |                  |

Royal Dutch and Shell merged to become Royal Dutch Shell.

Also remember Nobels, Samuels, Rothchilds.


##### How oil was initially found?

Oil found near surface in Pennsylvania. Drake went out to Pennsylvania and found the oil. In the 1860's they used heavy chisel shaped bits to get oil.
