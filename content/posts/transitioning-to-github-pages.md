This weekend I migrated my website over from Digital Ocean to Github Pages. I have hosted my website in the past on Github Pages, but I turned to self hosting due to the lack of support for custom domains and https. Both of these two issues have been addressed, so it made sense to switch back over.

Deploying my website now is even easier. Instead of having to ssh into my server each time I want to update my website, I just run hugo and do a git push. Github then takes care of the rest.
